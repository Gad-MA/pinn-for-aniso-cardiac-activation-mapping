We evaluated our framework on a synthetic 2D experiment. On a 35x35 grid over the domain $\Omega = [-1,1]^2$, we defined an anisotropic conduction velocity tensor field D(x, y) \cite{RuizHerrera2022}:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D}(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix} & \text{if } x + y < 0, \\
\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This piecewise configuration introduces sharp transition in conductivity properties and direction-dependent conduction, resembling the behavior observed in fibrotic or heterogeneous myocardial tissue. A ground-truth activation time map was generated by solving the anisotropic Eikonal equation using a Fast Iterative Method (FIM) \cite{Grandits2021}, with the stimulation site randomly selected via Latin hypercube sampling \cite{Stein1987}.

From the synthetic activation time map, 245 points were randomly sampled to simulate sparse catheter data. These samples served as input to the PINN framework, which aimed to reconstruct the activation time field $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ and the underlying conduction velocity tensor field $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{x})$

We trained the model for 3000 iterations (batch size 32) using the ADAM optimizer, with loss weights $\alpha_{\text{eiko}} = 10^{-2}$, $\alpha_{\text{reg}} = 10^{-5}$.

The PINN successfully reconstructed an activation time map closely matching the ground truth, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:results}, with RMSE of $0.0083 \ ms$. However, despite accurate wavefront recovery, the reconstructed conduction velocity tensor field showed a deviation from the true configuration, especially in regions with directional switching resulting in a mean deviation error of $24.754^\circ$

The framework successfully reconstructed activation times from sparse data with high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PINN framework in capturing wavefront propagation. Regularization through Huber total variation further improved the spatial coherence of the estimated conduction tensors, promoting smoothness in the absence of dense measurements. However, the reconstruction of the full conduction velocity tensor field is still limited.
